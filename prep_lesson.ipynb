    "- Start with 1 or more dataframes that we have acquired\n",
    "- summarize our data (head(), describe(), info(), isnull(), value_counts())\n",
    "- visualize the distributions of the variables (we are NOT looking at relationships of variables, just individual variables and the values that make those up).  (plt.hist(), sns.boxplot(), value_counts())\n",
    "\n",
    "- address missing values (sometimes we have to explore a little, to see how to address and then come back.)  (drop the rows, drop the columns, fill with 0, impute with mean, median, regression)\n",
    "- address outliers (drop the rows/observations, pin them to the max-non-outlier value, bin values, keep them)\n",
    "- data integrity issues, data errors (drop the rows/observations with the errors, correct them to what it was intended)\n",
    "- address text normalization issues...e.g. deck 'C' 'c'. (correct and standardize the text)\n",
    "- scale numeric data so that variables have the same weight, are on the same units (linear scalers and non-linear scalers)\n",
    "- convert text/objects/characters data into data that can be represented numerically. (encoding, manual transformations using conditionals, e.g.,  dummy variables)\n",
